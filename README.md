# Ecommerce Advanced Website Developed with React + Vite

I Built a fully functional, responsive and beautiful Ecommerce Website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Git and 
Github, Redux Toolkit and ECMAScript on ReactJs. I have used Firebase as a main database and server for authentications and data storage using advanced JavaScript async 
await methods and ECMA Script methods. This website is available on my Github ID. I have also hosted 
this website on Vercel at this address https://shahzaib-you-tube-clone.vercel.app to make it 
available to the public

Currently, available on:
